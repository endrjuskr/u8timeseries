========================================
Welcome to u8timeseries's documentation!

u8timeseries is a Python library for the manipulation and prediction of time series. The main goal is to provide easy access to various existing models and implementations in a single easy-to-use API.

Currently, we propose access the following models:

* ARIMA
* AUTO-ARIMA
* Prophet
* Simple Exponential Smoothing
* Theta
